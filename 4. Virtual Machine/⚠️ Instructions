⚪ Using the Virtual Machine:

 ⚪ Machine's specifications:
    
    Registries: 16 general-use registries, 8-bit wide each;
    
    Instructions: Virtual Machine reads 8-bits of instructions per cycle from a
                  binary file with two hexadecimal values per single instruction;
                
    Memory: 256 bytes of program memory,
    Flags: 2 flag registries (zero and EOF).
                
⚪ What this Virtual Machine does:

 ⚪ First step: Machine preloads the program memory with working instructions,
                 which are stored in "decryptor.bin" file;
 ⚪ Second step: Machine iterates through the program's memory and does various
                  tasks, like adding two registries together, jumping the
                  iterator variable and so on...
 ⚪ Third step: once the Machine finishes reading the encrypted text file, it
                 raises the EOF flag and stops working. Decrypted text can be
                 found in "results.txt" file.
                 

 💭 There is one encrypted file and it's decrypted variant provided with the
     code. 
     
⚠️ These instructions are not in-depth and do not explain Virtual Machine's
    working principle fully. Might add in-depth instructions with visual
    examples in the future.
