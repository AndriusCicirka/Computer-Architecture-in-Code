# Computer-Architecture-in-Code

Hello! 😀

💭 As written in the initial description, this repository is meant to store
various computer logic tasks written in C++.

💭 Such mini-tasks help to better understand the inner workings of
computer logic, yet broaden the knowledge of programming language
used (in this instance C++) to actually do them.

💭 Each sub-folder contains source code of the tasks, additional files
if required and basic instructions.

⚠️ By no means the code is written the best way possible. It is definintely
improvable, but as of now, this is not on the top of the To-Do list.

⏳ Until July 2022, this repository should contain total of 5 mini-tasks.
